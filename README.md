Code Plan 1: 

Step1: Convert string to arrays and print to result
Step2: sort the even numbers from the result to get the even numbers --> add the sorted even numbers to find the sum of even numbers(total)
Step3: Print the sum of even numbers 

Code Plan2:

Step1: Provided -> An array with weather data 
Step2: filter the keys name weather_state_name from the weather array 
Step3: Use higher order function for step 2 and print the same.
Step4: Find the id that has the value of temp = 15.915. Again the condition here is to use a higher order function.
